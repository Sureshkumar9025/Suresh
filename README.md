Introduction This project is designed to detect fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The code leverages machine learning models to classify news articles as either real or fake based on their content and features.

Getting Started Follow the instructions below to get the code up and running on your local machine.

Prerequisites Python 3.x Pip Virtual Environment (optional but recommended) Installation

Clone this repository: git clone (https://github.com/Sureshkumar9025/fake-news-detection-using-NLP.git)

Navigate to the project directory: cd fake-news-detection Create a virtual environment (optional): python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate Install required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt Usage Ensure you have set up the environment as described in the "Installation" section.

The main script for running the fake news detection model is fake_news_detection.py. You can customize this script according to your needs.

Execute the script: python fake_news_detection.py Data source : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

Dataset To train and test the fake news detection model, you will need a labeled dataset of news articles. You can use your own dataset or explore publicly available datasets like FakeNewsNet or LIAR. Make sure to preprocess and format your dataset appropriately.

Model Training You can train your NLP-based fake news detection model using the provided dataset. Customize the training script according to your dataset and model choice. Save the trained model weights for future inference.

Inference To classify a news article as real or fake, you can use the trained model by loading the saved weights. Input a news article, preprocess it, and use the model to predict its authenticity.

Results Document the results of your model's performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, and present them in a clear format. You can also showcase example predictions.

Dataset
To train and test the fake news detection model, you will need a labeled dataset of news articles. For this project, we used the [FakeNewsNet] (https://github.com/Sureshkumar9025/fake-news-detection-using-NLP.git) dataset.

FakeNewsNet Dataset
The FakeNewsNet dataset is a comprehensive collection of real and fake news articles with various attributes such as text content, social context, and multimedia content. It includes articles from multiple domains, making it suitable for training and testing a robust fake news detection model.

This dataset is divided into different sub-datasets, each focusing on a specific aspect of fake news:

PolitiFact: This sub-dataset contains fake and real news articles collected from PolitiFact.
Gossip Cop: This sub-dataset includes fake and real news articles related to celebrity gossip.
You can download the dataset from the provided GitHub repository and preprocess it according to your needs.

Description
Fake news detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) involves training a machine learning model to distinguish between real and fake news articles based on the language, structure, and content of the text. NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, feature extraction, and various machine learning algorithms can be employed to accomplish this task. The model learns to identify patterns and linguistic cues that are indicative of fake news, which can help in automatic classification.

The goal of this project is to build a robust fake news detection system that can contribute to the identification and mitigation of misinformation in the digital age. This section provides information about the dataset source and a brief overview of the task of fake news detection using NLP. You can further elaborate on the preprocessing steps and feature extraction techniques used in your specific project, as well as any additional details about the dataset.
